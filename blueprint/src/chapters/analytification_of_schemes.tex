\chapter{Analytification of a scheme}

In this chapter, unless explicitly specified, all schemes we work with are assumed to be locally of finite type over $\complex$.

\section{Toplogical story}

For an arbitrary scheme $\schemeOf{X}$, in this section, we denote $\operatorname{Max}{X}$ to be the set of all closed points of $X$ and $\operatorname{MaxSpec} R$ to be the set of all maximal ideals of a ring $R$. Not that $\operatorname{MaxSpec} R$ is exactly $\operatorname{Max}\left(\spec{R}\right)$
