\chapter{Analytification of a scheme}

In this chapter, unless explicitly specified, all schemes we work with are assumed to be locally of finite type over $\complex$.

\section{Toplogical story}


For an arbitrary scheme $\schemeOf{X}$, in this section, we denote $\an{X}$ to be the set of all closed points of $X$ and $\operatorname{MaxSpec} R$ to be the set of all maximal ideals of a ring $R$. Not that $\operatorname{MaxSpec} R$ is exactly $\an{\left(\specop{R}\right)}$ and we use both interchangeably.

\subsection{Affine scheme}

% \subsubsection{The special case of polynomial ring}

% In this section we work explicitly with $R := \complex[X_{1},\dots, X_{n}]$.

Let $S$ be a finitely generated $\complex$-algebra so that $S \cong \complex[a_{1},\dots, a_{n}]$ for some $a_{i} \in S$. Thus there is a surjection $\theta: \complex[X_{1}, \dots, X_{n}] \to S$ defined by $X_{i} \mapsto a_{i}$. Thus, we have a morphism $\Theta$ of schemes of finite type over $\complex$ between $\spec S$ to $\spec{\complex[X_{1},\dots, X_{n}]}$. By \Cref{thm:morph-maps-closed-points-to-closed-points}, we know that $\Theta$ gives us a continuous map
\[
%   We denote $\an{\left(\specop R\right)}$ to the space consisted of the closed points in $\specop R$ with the topology induced from $\complex^{n}$.
\operatorname{MaxSpec}\theta: \operatorname{MaxSpec} S \to \operatorname{MaxSpec} \complex[X_{1},\dots, X_{n}],
\]

since $\theta$ is surjective, $\operatorname{MaxSpec}\theta$ is injective\footnote{being the restriction of the injective function $\specop \theta$}.

\begin{theorem}
  The set of closed points in $\specop{\complex[X_{1},\dots, X_{n}]}$ corresponds bijectively to $\complex^{n}$.

\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  By \Cref{thm:affine-scheme-closed-points-biject-algebra-hom}, the set of closed points
  bijects to $\complex$-algebra homomorphisms $\complex[X_{1}, \dots, X_{n}] \to \complex$. Thus we only need a bijection between $\complex$-algebra homomorphism $\complex[X_{1}, \dots, X_{n}] \to \complex$ and $\complex^{n}$:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Give a point $p := (a_{1},\dots, a_{n}) \in \complex^{n}$, we define $\phi_{a}: \complex[X_{1},\dots, X_{n}] \to \complex$ to be evaluation at the point $p$.

    \item Give a $\complex$-algebra homomorphism $\phi$, we take the point to be $(\phi(X_{1}, \dots, X_{n}))$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}[Complex topology]
  The complex topology of $\specop S$ is the subspace topology of $\complex^{n}$ via the injective map $\maxspecop \theta$. With the complex topology, we denote $\maxspecop S$ as $\an{\left(\specop S\right)}$
\end{definition}

Note that by now we do not know that $\an{\left(\specop S\right)}$ is independent from the choice of generators $\{a_{1},\dots, a_{n}\}$, we will enventually prove that this is true, but let's write $\an{\left(\specop S\right)}_{a_{i}}$ to stress the dependency.

\begin{theorem}
If $S$, as $\complex$-algebras, is generated by both $a_{1},\dots, a_{n}$ and $b_{1},\dots,b_{m}$, we would have as topological spaces $\an{\left(\specop S\right)}_{a_{i}}$ and $\an{\left(\specop S\right)}_{b_{i}}$ are homeomophic.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  Let us abbreviate the polynomial rings $\complex[X_{1},\dots, X_{n}]$ as $R$ and $\complex[Y_{1},\dots, Y_{m}]$ as $R'$, then we have two surjective homomorphisms $\theta: R \to S$ and $\theta' : R' \to S$ such that $\theta(X_{i}) = a_{i}$ and $\theta'(Y_{i})=b_{i}$.

  It is sufficient, by symmetry, to prove topology induced by generators $b_{i}$'s is finer than that of $a_{i}$'s.

  Since $b_{i}$'s generate $S$ and $a_{i}$'s are in $S$, we can find $n$ polynomials $P_{i} \in R' = \complex[Y_{1},\dots, Y_{m}]$ such that $a_{i} = P_{i}(b_{1},\dots, b_{m})$. Thus we can define $\phi : R \to R'$ by $X_{i}\mapsto P_{i}(Y_{1},\dots, Y_{m})$ such that $\theta = \theta' \circ \phi$. Thus we have a commutative diagram (of plain functions)
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzcd}[column sep=large]
      {\an{\left(\specop S\right)}_{a_{i}}} \arrow{r}{\maxspecop\theta} \arrow[equal]{d}{} & \complex^{n} \\
      {\an{\left(\specop S\right)}_{b_{i}}} \arrow{r}{\maxspecop{\theta'}} & \complex^{m} \arrow{u}{\maxspecop{\phi}}
    \end{tikzcd}
  \end{center}

  $\maxspecop \theta$, $\maxspecop \theta'$ and $\maxspecop \phi$ are all continuous, thus the identity function $\an{\left(\specop S\right)}_{a_{i}} \to \an{\left(\specop S\right)}_{b_{i}}$ is continuous.

\end{proof}
